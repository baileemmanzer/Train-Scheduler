# Train-Scheduler

## About
This is my train schedule application which incorporates Firebase to host arrival and departure data. Using Moment.js my application retrieves and manipulates this information. My website provides up-to-date information about various trains arrival times and how many minutes remain until the next arrival. It is also *very pink*.
